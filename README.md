image.macro
===========

`image.macro` is a [babel macro] for loading images into a project. If, for example I wanted to make a
photo gallery for the web I would want to have the images pre-rendered at various sizes so that
mobile users do not need to download and then downscale my largest images. However, generating these
images and committing them to a repo creates huge churn.
